# Kaggle Notebooks

Kaggle is a platform for predictive modelling and analytics competitions in which statisticians and data miners compete to produce the
best models for predicting and describing the datasets uploaded by companies and users.

In this repository you can check my work on Kaggle. You can also review my Kaggle profile [here](https://www.kaggle.com/xvivancos/kernels).
